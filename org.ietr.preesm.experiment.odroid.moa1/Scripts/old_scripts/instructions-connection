# How to start a new batch of tests on Odroid

## How to launch a test energy measurement

* Try with scenario 64 first ("TestComPC_64.scenario").
* Unzip the scenario from Scenarios_1.zip
* It contains the timings of tasks for scheduling and sets all actors on Core 0.

* Connects the Odroid in SSH with IP 192.168.0.2 (look into the file Code/scripts/SSH connection for ideas on how to connect).
* You need to remove the password need for sudo on Odroid, to do so, type:

sudo visudo
Then add at the end of the file
odroid ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

!!TO BE REMOVED BEFORE CONNECTING THE ODROID TO A NETWORK!!

* Use sshfs to get access to the file system

sshfs odroid@192.168.0.2:/ ~/Temp/odroid
cd ~/Temp/odroid/home/odroid

* Launch Code/scripts/measure1energy.sh

The script runs Preesm, generates code, copies it to the odroid, compile it with gcc, starts the energy measuring script, executes the program, and copies back the energy information on the PC.

## To Run PREESM with GUI on, do not forget to execute

export SWT_GTK3=0

To deactivate the slow GTK3 before launching ./eclipse in the same console
