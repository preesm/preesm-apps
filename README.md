preesm-apps
===========

Repository for PREESM applications.

*Tutorials* folder contains projects for the different tutorials proposed on the PREESM website (http://preesm.sourceforge.net/website/index.php?id=tutorials).

*.library* projects contain files (architecture descriptions, algorithm descriptions, code and workflows) you can reuse in your own project, enabling rapid start.

The *.dummy* file makes git keep its containing directory in repository. These directories are
necessary to successful compilation but are not tracked as such. Please copy the *.dummy* file to the following directories in the project you want to add to the repo:
- Code/generated/
- subfolders of Algo/generated/ (DAG/, flatten/, singlerate/)
