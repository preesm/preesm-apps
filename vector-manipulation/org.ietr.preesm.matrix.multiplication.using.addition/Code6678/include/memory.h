	              These functions replace the regular malloc() and free()
				  functions when code is printed with dynamic allocation and

/**
* Allocation function used when a single pointer is allocated several times.
* This method ensures that only its first call actually performs the
* allocation.
*
* @param sharedHeap
* 		Heap on which the data should be allocated
* @param pointer
*		Adress of the pointer to allocate. The pointer value must be null (=0)
*       if this is the first call to this function. Otherwise, a previous call
*       to this function will have allocated the memory and the pointer value
*       will not be null.
* @param size
*       The amount of memory to allocate in byte. The function will allocate
*       more memory than this value in order to store a semaphore used to
*       ensure that the number of free is correct.
* @param nbFree
*       Number of call to the merged_free function for this buffer. Only the
*       last call will actually free the memory.
* @param mutex
*       Semaphore (used as a mutex) used to ensure that no concurrent
*       calls to multiple_malloc() are effectively running.
* @param mutexID
* 		Unique character string used to identify the semaphore associated to
* 		this memory.
* @param align
* 		The desired alignment of the allocated memory.
*
* @return a pointer to the allocated memory.
