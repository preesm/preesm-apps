 * - id:        Character string used to identify the GateMP associated to the
 *              semaphore. This ID must be unique.
 * - value:     Integer value associated to the semaphore.
 * - creatorID: Integer id of the core that created this semaphore. Only this
 *              core may delete the GateMP associated to this semaphore.

 * 		Character string used as a unique identifier for the GateMP associated
 * 		to this semaphore. The behavior of this function with a non-unique ID

 * semaphore (sem_init()), the function closes and deletes the GateMP.
 * Otherwise, this function sends a notification event to the sem->creatorID
 * core. This notification will be received by the sem_destroyCallback()
 * callback function of the remote core.

 * GateMP_Handle in the semaphoresToClean() array.
 *
 * @param payload
 * 		The GateMP_Handle of the semaphore that must be deleted.
