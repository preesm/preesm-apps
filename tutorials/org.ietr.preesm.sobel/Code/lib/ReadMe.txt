This file contains instructions to setup the libraries in order to compile the
code generated by the org.ietr.preesm.sobel preesm project. 

Instructions have been tested for:
- Windows 7 
  - Code::Blocks (MinGW)
  - Visual Studio 2008
  
The project compilation requires the following libraries:
- SDL (v1.2)
- pthread 

***************************************
***             SDL v1.2            ***
***************************************

1. Download the SDL Development libraries corresponding to your IDE. 
   http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   Among the different proposed libraries, make sure you use the "Development libraries"


2. Decompress the dowloaded file in the following directory:
   /org.ietr.preesm.sobel/Code/lib/SDL-1.2.xx/

3. Make sure the appropriate SDL.dll (32 or 64 bits) is always in the 
   lib/SDL-1.2.xx/lib/ directory to execute the compiled project. This DLL is 
   available in the lib or bin directory of the uncompressed archive. 
   The given *.bat scripts will automatically copy the DLLs into the folders
   were the *.exe binary will be generated.
   
***************************************
***             pthread             ***
***************************************

1. Download the pthread library:
   ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe

2. Execute te downloaded executable to decompress its content in a temporary
   directory.

3. Copy the content of the decompressed /Pre-built.2/ directory into
   /org.ietr.preesm.sobel/Code/lib/pthread-2.8.0/

4. Make sure the /lib/pthreadGC2.dll and /lib/pthreadGCE2.dll are accessible to
   execute the compiled project. (cf. step 3 of SDL instructions)
