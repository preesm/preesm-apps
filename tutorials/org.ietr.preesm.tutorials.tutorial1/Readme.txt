This tutorial project contains:

- A PREESM workflow with application flattening, mapping and code generation
- A simple application named TestCom (without hierarchy)
- The architecture model of a PC with 2 cores interconnected by a shared memory
- The associated code, IDL with function prototypes and CMakeLists to execute the code

To launch PREESM on this tutorial:

- Import the org.ietr.preesm.tutorials.tutorial1 project into your Workspace
- Right-click on the workflow. Choose the unique scenario
- Wait for the end of the mapping or stop it from the "Best Latency" editor
