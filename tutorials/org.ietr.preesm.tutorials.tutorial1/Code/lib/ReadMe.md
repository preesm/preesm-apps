## Content 

This file contains instructions to setup the libraries in order to compile the

Instructions have been tested for:

* Windows 7 
  * Code::Blocks (MinGW)
  * Visual Studio 2013
* Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)
  
The project compilation requires the following libraries:

* pthread 
* SDL2


## pthread

2. On windows, unzip the archive and compy its content to ```/<project-path>/lib/pthread-2.X.Y/```
3. Your directory /<project-path>/lib/pthread-2.X.Y/ should contain:
