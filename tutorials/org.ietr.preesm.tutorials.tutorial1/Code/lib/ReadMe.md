# Guideline for Libraries Installation
## Content 

This file contains instructions to setup the libraries in order to compile the
code generated by the org.ietr.preesm.tutorial1 preesm project. 

Instructions have been tested for:

* Windows 7 
  * Code::Blocks (MinGW)
  * Visual Studio 2013
  
The project compilation requires the following libraries:

* pthread 
* SDL2

## pthread 
1. Download the pthread library:   
   [pthread-w32-2-8-0-release.exe](ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe)
2. Execute te downloaded executable to decompress its content in a temporary directory.
3. Copy the content of the decompressed /Pre-built.2/ directory into a folder named exactly as follows:  
  ```/<project-path>/lib/pthread-2.8.0/```  
  (where <project-path> is replaced with your project path).
4. Your directory /<project-path>/lib/pthread-2.8.0/ should contain:
   - include/
   - lib/
   - README
   - ...
