This file contains instructions to setup the libraries in order to compile the
code generated by the sobel-example preesm project. 

Instructions are provided for:
- Windows 7 
  - Code::Blocks (MinGW)
  - Visual Studio 2008
  
The project compilation requires the following libraries:
- SDL (v1.2)
- pthread

***             SDL v1.2            ***
***************************************

1. Download the SDL Development libraries corresponding to your IDE. 
   http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   Among the different proposed libraries, make sure you use the "Development libraries"


2. Decompress the dowloaded file in the following directory:
   /sobel-example/Code/lib/SDL-1.2.xx/

3. Make sure the appropriate SDL.dll is always accessible to execute the 
   compiled project. This DLL is available in the lib or bin directory of the 
   uncompressed archive. To make it accessible, you can either place it in a
   directory referenced in the PATH environment variable, or simply copy it in
   the directory where your IDE executes the compiled application. 
   In Code::blocks -> where the "*.exe" file is created.
   In VC -> At the root of the solution directory.

***             pthread             ***
***************************************

1. Download the pthread library:
   ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe

2. Execute te downloaded executable to decompress its content in a temporary
   directory.

3. Copy the content of the decompressed /Pre-built.2/ directory into
   /sobel-example/Code/lib/pthread-2.8.0/

4. Make sure the /lib/pthreadGC2.dll and /lib/pthreadGCE2.dll are accessible to
   execute the compiled project. (cf. step 3 of SDL instructions)
